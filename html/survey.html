        <p>Dear Participant,<br /><br /></p>
        <p><strong>Effectively using Business Intelligence (BI) tools</strong> is becoming increasingly important to derive insights from the huge amount of collected data and <strong>make better business decisions.</strong> However, many companies still do not leverage the full potential of these tools. Therefore, this research project, running at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute of Information Systems and Marketing (<a title="ISSD" href="http://issd.iism.kit.edu" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US">Research Group Information Systems and Service Design</span></a>, Prof. Dr. Alexander Mädche), aims to <strong>assess your current usage</strong> of BI tools and <strong>identify areas for improvement.<br /><br /></strong></p>
        <p>If you are a user of BI tools, we would like to invite you to take part in the project by completing a short survey which will just take about <strong>10 minutes. </strong>You can be assured that all of your responses will be treated <strong>absolutely confidentially</strong>. The survey is <strong>completely anonymous</strong> and only aggregate results will be published. Your honest response to each question is extremely important to the outcome of this project. You can <strong>take breaks at any time</strong> and continue later. The <strong>survey saves your answers</strong> and you can resume where you left off. <br /><br />If you like, we offer to give you feedback with recommendations via a <strong>dedicated feedback report</strong>. To receive the report, please enter your email address on the last page of the survey.<br /><br /></p>
        <p>If you have any questions regarding this study, please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:sebastian.classen@student.kit.edu">contact us</a>. </p>
