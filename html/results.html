                The Tools were evaluated in 4 categories: Usefulness, Ease of Use,
                Perceived Benefits, and Intention to Use the tool. The maximum score that could  be reached is 100.
                In the following you can choose one of the evaluation categories or an overall score to display the
                10 tools with the highest average rating in this category.</span>

                <span>To make BI Tools ready for business users, it is important that they are easy to use. Ease of use however sometimes
                comes at the expense of usefulness, because advanced and very useful features are not programmed into the tool
                to not confuse the user.
                Therefore, the below chart displays ease of use and usefulness of each tool. The thickness of the bubbles
                represents how often each tool is used.
