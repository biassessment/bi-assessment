            <strong>Effectively using Business Intelligence (BI) tools</strong> is becoming increasingly important to
            derive insights from the huge amount of collected data and <strong>make better business decisions.</strong>
            However, many companies still do not leverage the full potential of these tools. Therefore, this research
            project, running at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Institute of Information Systems and Marketing
            (<a title="ISSD" href="http://issd.iism.kit.edu" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US">Research Group
                Information Systems and Service Design</span></a>, Prof. Dr. Alexander Mädche), aims to
            <strong>assess how BI Tools are used</strong> and <strong>identify areas for improvement.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <h4>
            The KIT BI Assessment Tool offers the following three options:
        </h4>
        <h3>
            1. Rate your own BI Tool
        </h3>
        <p>If you are a user of BI tools and would like to find out how your tool rates compared to others for your specific
            tasks, we would like to invite you to complete a short
            survey which will just take about <strong>10 minutes. </strong>You can be assured that all of your responses
            will be treated <strong>absolutely confidentially</strong>. The survey is <strong>completely
                anonymous</strong> and only aggregate results will be published. Your honest response to each question
            is extremely important to the outcome of this project.
        </p>
        <p>
            After completing the survey you will <b>get access to your personal results area</b> and see where you can improve.

        <h3>
            2. Find out the best BI Tool for your specific purposes
        </h3>
        <p>
            If <b>you don't have a BI Tool yet</b> and you would like to know, which tool best support your specific needs,
            you can find the answers by completing a very short survey (2-3 minutes) regarding your business decisions
            that you would like to support with a BI tool, and we will match your answers against our benchmarking
            database to provide you with an optimal solution.

        <h3>
            3. Look up your personal results
        </h3>
        <p>
            Have you completed the survey yet? Then it's time to look up your personal results in the results area.
            Since out benchmarking database is constantly growing, the results may change over time. In the results area
            you can always access the most recent results.
